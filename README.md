# PhysicsSim
Various Physical Simulations for the intended purpose of building up from fundementals to tackle larger complexity in mechanical systems.

## Road map

0. Implement a simple vector class using my old Matrix Library.
1. Simple Particle Simulation: To set a foundation for graphics.
2. Orbiting Body: To set a foundation for camera behavior.
3. Wave simulation: To set a foundation for Fourier representations.
4. Lorenz Attracter: To set a foundation for chaotic systems.

Implement these to simulate a turbulent system in a box.

5. Particle Collision: To set a foundation for inertia and impulse.
6. Chain falling out of a cup: To set a foundation for coupled systems.
7. Jelly block: To set a foundation for soft-body collisions.
8. Compression valve: To set a foundation for pressure interactions.

Implement these to simulate a soft-body interaction with pressure waves.
